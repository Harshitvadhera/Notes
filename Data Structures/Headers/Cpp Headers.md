**XOR**
It is an operator which returns 0 for same value and 1 for different value so whenever we need to cancel out two values we can apply the xor operator.

`!` Whenever we do XOR (^) of any value with Zero answer is always the value.

| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |
`!` Whenever we want to cancel out two same values always apply XOR operator.
