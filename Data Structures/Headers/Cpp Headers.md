**XOR**
It is an operator which returns 0 for same value and 1 for different value so whenever we need to cancel out two values we can apply the xor operator.

`!` Whenever we do XOR (^) of any value with Zero answer is always the value.

| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |
`!` Whenever we want to cancel out two same values always apply XOR operator.

**XOR of the first n numbers**:
    - If n is even: the result is 0.
    - If n is odd: the result is n.

> [!Example]
> Let's apply this property to the sequence of numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5:
> 
> Given n=5 which is odd, the result is n, i.e., 5.
> 
> So, 0⊕1⊕2⊕3⊕4⊕5=5
> Similarly, 0⊕1⊕2⊕3⊕4⊕5⊕6⊕7⊕8⊕9⊕10=0. //As n is even here.
